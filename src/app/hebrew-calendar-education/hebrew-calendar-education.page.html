    <h1>📅 Understanding the Hebrew Calendar, Biblical Holidays, and the Bible in a Year Schedule</h1>

    <h2>📖 How the Bible is Divided</h2>
    <p>The Bible is traditionally divided into four key sections:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Torah – The Five Books of Moses</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Genesis (Bereshit)</li>
          <li>Exodus (Shemot)</li>
          <li>Leviticus (Vayikra)</li>
          <li>Numbers (Bamidbar)</li>
          <li>Deuteronomy (Devarim)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section forms the foundation of God's covenant, the giving of the Law, and the journey of Israel from creation to the edge of the Promised Land.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Nevi'im – The Prophets</strong>
        <p>Includes the historical books like Joshua, Judges, and Samuel, as well as the major and minor prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ketuvim – The Writings</strong>
        <p>A diverse section including poetry, wisdom, and narrative books like Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ruth, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Brit Chadashah – The New Testament</strong>
        <p>The testimony of Yeshua (Jesus), including the Gospels, Acts, Letters (Epistles), and Revelation.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our reading plan includes daily passages from each of these four sections (Torah, Prophets, Writings, and New Testament), offering a balanced journey through the entire Bible in one year.</p>

    <h2>🕯️ The Hebrew Calendar</h2>
    <p>The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar, meaning it is based on both the moon phases and the solar year. Months begin with the new moon, and extra months are added occasionally to align with the seasons.</p>

    <h3>🌙 Months of the Hebrew Calendar</h3>
    <p>Some of the key months include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nisan</strong> – Begins the biblical year, includes Passover</li>
      <li><strong>Tishrei</strong> – The seventh month; includes Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot</li>
      <li><strong>Kislev, Adar, etc.</strong> – Each month has its unique spiritual themes and sometimes minor holidays</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🕎 Biblical Holidays and Sabbaths</h2>
    <p>Throughout the year, there are appointed times (mo’edim) for rest, remembrance, and worship:</p>

    <h3>🌾 Spring Holidays:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Passover (Pesach)</strong> – Remembering the Exodus</li>
      <li><strong>Unleavened Bread</strong> – A week-long feast</li>
      <li><strong>First Fruits</strong> – Offering of the early harvest</li>
      <li><strong>Shavuot (Pentecost)</strong> – Commemorates the giving of the Torah</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🍇 Fall Holidays:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Yom Teruah (Feast of Trumpets / Rosh Hashanah)</strong> – A day of sounding the shofar</li>
      <li><strong>Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement)</strong> – The holiest day of the year</li>
      <li><strong>Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles)</strong> – A joyful week in temporary shelters</li>
      <li><strong>Simchat Torah</strong> – Rejoicing in the Torah, when the annual Torah reading cycle begins again</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🕊️ Weekly Sabbath (Shabbat):</h3>
    <p>Every Friday evening to Saturday evening, a day of rest, prayer, and special readings.</p>
    <p>On holidays and Sabbaths, the regular daily Bible reading plan is adjusted to include traditional readings for that event. These special readings deepen our understanding of God's timing and message.</p>

    <h2>🔁 The Reading Cycle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Bible-in-a-Year plan offered here:</li>
      <li>Starts with Genesis 1 on Simchat Torah (the day after Sukkot ends)</li>
      <li>Provides a daily selection from each section: Torah, Prophets, Writings, and New Testament</li>
      <li>Includes special readings on Sabbaths and Feast Days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This structure honors the traditional divisions of Scripture while allowing modern disciples of Yeshua to read the entire Bible in one year.</p>
