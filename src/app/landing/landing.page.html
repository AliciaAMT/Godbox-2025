                The Way is for followers of Yeshua who seek a closer, more fulfilling relationship with HaShem, the One God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The meaning of the word "Christian" has been hijacked and turned into something our beloved Meshiach would never have approved of. Many reform groups have attempted to return to The Way that Yeshua originally preached, and their success has been equivalent to how dedicated they are staying true to the spirit of the scripture in their doctrines.

              <p class="message">
                Instead of a new doctrine, The Way is about finding out what He wants for each of us individually. Instead of grudging obedience to what other people tell us we are supposed to do, we ask the Father directly. And He Answers!

                  Both "The Way" and "Kahal" are works in progress. "The Way" is a scripture-based spiritual program designed to help you strengthen your relationship with our Creator, and is mainly a collection of articles with the abilitiy to comment. "Kahal" has a similar, but different purpose to connect believers online, and offer some organization in facilitating Bible studies and local ministries. There will be zoom meetings, chat, Bible study groups and other features.

                  Prevailing themes among the Hebrew Roots and Messianic Jewish communites have been the lack of a centralized place to connect with other believers, a lack of organization, and confusion about core beliefs and practices. Even the terms "Hebrew Roots" and "Messianic Judaism" mean different things to different people.

                  Time after time I have seen people asking in social media groups how to find a fellowship or start thier own. I have heard from people with financial and health disabilities who want a way to fellowship with others from home. I have myself experienced the need for a connection to other believers when there was no church in my area that did not go against my convictions.

                <p class="message">
                  Another issue has been lack of organization. While strict church heirarchies appear to be unbliblical, so is chaos. In our zeal to reject traditional church authorities, we have become too loose and unorganized. We need a way to connect with other believers with a clear mission, to share resources, and to organize our efforts.
                </p>
                <p class="message">
                  Which brings me to core beliefs. There are many different beliefs and practices among the Hebrew Roots and Messianic Jewish communities. Some of these are biblical, some are not. Some are based on tradition, some are not. There has come a time when we need to come together and agree on what is biblical and what is not, at least with core beliefs and practices. Perhaps then the terms "Hebrew Roots" and "Messianic Judaism" will have a clear meaning versus the confusion that exists today.

                  Until kahal.app is ready for the public, this domain, theway417.org , will be the place to see the progress of the development, use what we have so far including a Bible reading schedule, and read and create (after application and approval) content. There are even plans for a journal, prayer, and planner calandar app, the domain "thegodbox.app" is already reserved. These are exciting times. Be a part of the kahal before it even begins!
